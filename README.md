# Pomodoro Timer

When it comes to time management methods, the Pomodoro technique is great. Itâ€™s quite
effective and pretty easy to follow. The Pomodoro Process has four primary steps:

- Setting a 25-minute timer for a task to be done.
- Work on the task at hand for 25 minutes until the timer chimers.
- Take a short break (typically for 5-10 minutes).
- After four pomodoros, take a long break (15-20 minutes).

The app is built using:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React JS
